1. User Onboarding & Personalization
The platform begins with a role-based onboarding system designed to personalize the entire user
journey. When a student logs in for the first time, they complete a short questionnaire about:
 Field – CS, MBBS, Accounting, Marketing, Law, Mechanical Engineering, etc.  Target Role –
“Python Intern”, “Staff Nurse”, “Sales Associate”, “Accountant”, etc.  Level – UG/PG, Fresher,
Working professional.  Skills – Python, Excel, AutoCAD, Communication, etc.  Career Intent –
Jobs, internships, resume building, interview prep, skill improvement.
Real Example: A 2nd-year BBA student logs in and selects: - Field: Management - Role: Marketing
Intern - Skills: Excel, Social Media - Level: Undergrad Your dashboard now tailors: - Resume
template for marketing - Marketing interview questions - Jobs related to internships - ATS
suggestions relevant to business roles

2. Personalized Dashboard Experience
Once onboarding is complete, the student enters a personalized dashboard built specifically around
their profile.
What the dashboard shows:  Career Track (“Marketing Intern – Undergrad”)  Daily Goals
(Practice interview, Improve resume, Check jobs, etc.)  Streak (e.g., “■ 4-Day Progress Streak”) 
Recommended tools (Resume, ATS, Jobs, DSA for CS students)
3. Streak & Motivation System
Your streak system keeps the student active daily. Any meaningful action counts toward the streak:
✓ Solving or attempting a DSA question ✓ Running resume generation ✓ Performing an ATS check
✓ Practicing an AI interview ✓ Checking job recommendations
Real-life scenario: A Commerce student logs in, updates their resume, and checks two job listings.
This counts as a day of progress. The next day, they only do an ATS check → streak continues. If
they miss 2 days → streak resets to 1.

4. AI Resume Generator (Fully Dynamic)
The resume generator takes user inputs and builds a fully formatted, ATS-friendly resume using AI.
Process: 1. Student fills simple form (education, skills, projects). 2. Backend sends structured
JSON to LLM. 3. AI returns:  Summary  Skills  Experience bullets  Project descriptions 
Achievements 4. You render the resume in HTML → export to PDF.
Example Output (For a CS Student): “Built REST APIs in Django handling 2,000+ daily requests.”
“Implemented DSA-based algorithms improving processing time by 35%.”

5. ATS Score Analyzer
The ATS checker simulates how applicant tracking systems evaluate resumes.
Workflow: 1. Student uploads their resume. 2. They paste the LinkedIn/Indeed job description. 3.
Your backend extracts text from the resume. 4. AI compares both documents and returns:  Match
score (0–100)  Missing keywords  Strengths  Suggestions  Example improved bullet points
Real Example: Job: “Finance Intern – Excel, Accounting, Reporting” Resume missing: Reporting,
Financial modeling AI suggests: - “Added financial reporting using Google Sheets for 50+ entries.”

6. Job Finder & Redirection System
Instead of scraping, the platform redirects students to official job boards using smart search links.
Example: Field: Mechanical Role: CAD Design Intern City: Pune Generated Links: - LinkedIn:
“CAD Intern Pune” - Naukri: “Mechanical Intern Pune” - Indeed: “AutoCAD Trainee Pune”
The student sees lists of jobs personalized for their profile and can click → opens the job on official
site.

7. AI Interview Practice (Text + Voice)
Students practice domain-specific interviews through text or voice.
Text Interview Flow:
1. AI asks domain-relevant question 2. Student responds 3. AI evaluates answer 4. AI gives
feedback 5. AI asks next question
Voice Interview Flow:
1. AI speaks question using TTS 2. User answers using mic 3. Audio → STT → Transcription 4.
Transcript → LLM → Scoring + next question 5. Summary generated at end
Real Example: Marketing student answer: “I created a social media calendar for my college fest.”
AI feedback: “Good start. Add measurable outcomes — e.g., +40% engagement.”

8. DSA Prep (CS/IT Students Only)
The DSA section only appears for CS/IT students. It supports two modes:
1. Linked Problems (recommended for MVP)
 Store problem titles + topics + difficulty  Link to LeetCode/GFG  Students track their progress
internally  AI can still explain solution patterns
2. AI-Generated DSA Problems (advanced)
 System generates original problems using AI  Includes: - Statement - Examples - Constraints -
Solution approach  Students solve inside your app  AI evaluates their approach
Real Example: AI Problem (Arrays – Easy): “Given an array, find the number of unique pairs
whose sum equals K.” AI also generates input/output & optimal solution.

9. Motivation, Gamification & Engagement
Your platform becomes addictive when you add:
✓ Streaks ✓ Daily goals ✓ XP points ✓ Badges (Resume Pro, DSA Rookie, Interview Star) ✓
Weekly performance reports ✓ Personalized improvement suggestions
Real-life Example: A CS student logs in: - Solves 1 DSA question - Practices 1 interview question -
Updates resume → Earns 8 XP → Streak continues → “DSA Beginner Badge Unlocked!”
